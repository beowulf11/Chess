**Social Networks**

Social networks are now standard for everyday life if you agree or not. People all over the world rely on them to communicate with other, arrange meeting and much more. Weather they will bring down society and destroy personal relationships or help people is in my opinion everyone's choice.

The advantages are seen on first glance. Communicate and get up to date with people who are thousands of miles away from you. No need to send a letter and wait weeks and in some instances moths for it to arrive. Just login online and you can immediately chat for free. The free nature of these service is also a huge argument if you want persuade someone to use them.

On the other hand the the bad parts can also be seen very easily. Firstly people often use them for social bullying or other forms of harassment. Secondly they may cause breaking of social connections between people. A lot of users don't value their private life so they will post every detail of their life online which can often be abused.

Overall these social networks may serve as a good substitute for writing a letter to someone but also as a replacement for social interaction. It all depends on people who use these social networks. Whether you use them to compliment your social life or replace all real world connections with friends and family is up to you.

Social network are integrated to our life's more than ever. For most people it is unfathomable to even image giving up their social account, whether it is Facebook, Twitter or other similar sites. It's become part of our culture. But I am not exactly sure most people understand how this companies work.

A few months back there was a huge scandal concerning Facebook. It was about users privacy or the lack of it. Basically a 3rd party firm was able to scrape data of millions of Facebook users without their knowledge. Many people were rightly outraged but didn't realize that no illegal act was being done. The data that was being collected was from users that answered questions about themselves but what was being done without the users knowing was that all of the friends of this person also had every detail from their profile scooped up and stored to be processed later. And processed later it was. It was reported that a big influence on the 2016 election in USA was Facebook ads. 

If you really think about it how can a big company be financially stable when they are not selling any products. If you are found in this situation and you use this service more often than not the product you are not seeing thats being sold is you. In our digital world today data is of huge importance. And getting more of it and more accurate is precisely what companies want. It is not easy to find the habits, desires and dreams of millions of people. Usually people are reluctant to give a lot of personal information, but not on social-media sites.

But what exactly is this data good for? Surely the information of what I have eaten daily or my random thoughts posted online could not help anyone or by somehow abused by someone. Ads. You see them all over internet, perhaps you may even try to get rid of them but if we want a free experience they are here to stay. Whats more nefarious is specially crafted ads that are disguised as news or random facts that try to shame or influence you to align with someones else perspective. 

There are of course a lot a benefits of using a social network, you can stay in touch with family and friends in an easy way. You can see whats happening to your friends and family where have they been what are they doing and general news about people you cannot possible keep in touch all the time. But the same information you see, can be also seen by companies who can extract this information and use it for their own agenda. I am not advocating for the complete ban on social networks but a little education of people of what is actually happening would hurt nobody and in my opinion be hugely positi
